# MeepMeep Module

This module is where our team can test trajectories for the 30 second autonomous period. 

All other classes should use `MeepMeepConfig.getConfig()` to standardize how MeepMeep is set up. If you want to make a runnable class, just make sure to include `public static void main(String[] args){}` and put your code between the braces.
