# Release Information

## Version 8.0 (20220907-131644)

### Breaking Changes
* Increases the Robocol version.
  * This means an 8.0 or later Robot Controller or Driver Station will not be able to communicate with a 7.2 or earlier Driver Station or Robot Controller.
  * If you forget to update both apps at the same time, an error message will be shown explaining which app is older and should be updated.
* Initializing I2C devices now happens when you retrieve them from the `HardwareMap` for the first time.
  * Previously, all I2C devices would be initialized before the Op Mode even began executing,
    whether you were actually going to use them or not. This could result in reduced performance and
    unnecessary warnings.
  * With this change, it is very important for Java users to retrieve all needed devices from the
    `HardwareMap` **during the Init phase of the Op Mode**. Namely, declare a variable for each hardware
    device the Op Mode will use, and assign a value to each. Do not do this during the Run phase, or your
    Op Mode may briefly hang while the devices you are retrieving get initialized.
  * Op Modes that do not use all of the I2C devices specified in the configuration file should take
    less time to initialize. Op Modes that do use all of the specified I2C devices should take the
    same amount of time as previously.
* Fixes [issue #251](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/251) by changing the order in which axis rotation rates are read from the angular velocity vector in the BNO055 IMU driver.
* Deprecates `pitchMode` in `BNO055IMU.Parameters`.
  * Setting `pitchMode` to `PitchMode.WINDOWS` would break the coordinate conventions used by the driver.
* Moves `OpModeManagerImpl` to the `com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode` package.
  * This breaks third party libraries EasyOpenCV (version 1.5.1 and earlier) and FTC Dashboard (version 0.4.4 and earlier).
* Deletes the deprecated `OpMode` method `resetStartTime()` (use `resetRuntime()` instead).
* Deletes the protected `LinearOpMode.LinearOpModeHelper` class (which was not meant for use by Op Modes).
* Removes I2C Device (Synchronous) config type (deprecated since 2018)

### Enhancements
* Uncaught exceptions in Op Modes no longer require a Restart Robot
  * A blue screen popping up with a stacktrace is not an SDK error; this replaces the red text in the telemetry area.
  * Since the very first SDK release, Op Mode crashes have put the robot into "EMERGENCY STOP" state, only showing the first line of the exception, and requiring the user to press "Restart Robot" to continue
  * Exceptions during an Op Mode now open a popup window with the same color scheme as the log viewer, containing 15 lines of the exception stacktrace to allow easily tracing down the offending line without needing to connect to view logs over ADB or scroll through large amounts of logs in the log viewer.
  * The exception text in the popup window is both zoomable and scrollable just like a webpage.
  * Pressing the "OK" button in the popup window will return to the main screen of the Driver Station and allow an Op Mode to be run again immediately, without the need to perform a "Restart Robot"
* Adds new Java sample to demonstrate using a hardware class to abstract robot actuators, and share them across multiple Op Modes.
  * Sample Op Mode is [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples/ConceptExternalHardwareClass.java](ConceptExternalHardwareClass.java)
  * Abstracted hardware class is [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples/RobotHardware.java](RobotHardware.java))
* Updates RobotAutoDriveByGyro_Linear Java sample to use REV Control/Expansion hub IMU.
* Updates Vuforia samples to reference PowerPlay assets and have correct names and field locations of image targets.
* Updates TensorFlow samples to reference PowerPlay assets.
* Adds opt-in support for Java 8 language features to the OnBotJava editor.
  * To opt in, open the OnBotJava Settings, and check `Enable beta Java 8 support`.
  * Note that Java 8 code will only compile when the Robot Controller runs Android 7.0 Nougat or later.
  * Please report issues [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues).
* In OnBotJava, clicking on build errors now correctly jumps to the correct location.
* Improves OnBotJava autocomplete behavior, to provide better completion options in most cases.
* Adds a QR code to the Robot Controller Inspection Report when viewed from the Driver Station for scanning by inspectors at competition.
* Improves I2C performance and reliability in some scenarios.

## Version 7.2 (20220723-130006)

### Breaking Changes
* Updates the build tooling.  For Android Studio users, this change requires Android Studio Chipmunk 2021.2.1.
* Removes support for devices that are not competition legal, including Modern Robotics Core Control Modules, the Matrix Controller, and HiTechnic/NXT controllers and sensors.  Support remains for Modern Robotics I2C sensors.

### Enhancements
* Increases the height of the 3-dots Landscape menu touch area on the Driver Station, making it much easier to select.
* Adds `terminateOpModeNow()` method to allow OpModes to cleanly self-exit immediately.
* Adds `opModeInInit()` method to `LinearOpMode` to facilitate init-loops. Similar to `opModeIsActive()` but for the init phase.
* Warns user if they have a Logitech F310 gamepad connected that is set to DirectInput mode.
* Allows SPARKmini motor controllers to react more quickly to speed changes.
* Hides the version number of incorrectly installed sister app (i.e. DS installed on RC device or vice-versa) on inspection screen.
* Adds support for allowing the user to edit the comment for the runOpMode block.
* Adds parameterDefaultValues field to @ExportToBlocks. This provides the ability for a java method with an @ExportToBlocks annotation to specify default values for method parameters when it is shown in the block editor.
* Make LinearOpMode blocks more readable. The opmode name is displayed on the runOpMode block, but not on the other LinearOpMode blocks.
* Added support to TensorFlow Object Detection for using a different frame generator, instead of Vuforia.
  Using Vuforia to pass the camera frame to TFOD is still supported.
* Removes usage of Renderscript.
* Fixes logspam on app startup of repeated stacktraces relating to `"Failed resolution of: Landroid/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager$DeviceInfoListener"`
* Allows disabling bluetooth radio from inspection screen
* Improves warning messages when I2C devices are not responding
* Adds support for controlling the RGB LED present on PS4/Etpark gamepads from OpModes
* Removes legacy Pushbot references from OpMode samples.  Renames "Pushbot" samples to "Robot".  Motor directions reversed to be compatible with "direct Drive" drive train. 
 

### Bug fixes
* Fixes [issue #316](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/316) (MatrixF.inverted() returned an incorrectly-sized matrix for 1x1 and 2x2 matrixes).
* Self inspect now allows for Driver Station and Robot Controller compatibility between point releases.
* Fixes bug where if the same `RumbleEffect` object instance was queued for multiple gamepads, it
  could happen that both rumble commands would be sent to just one gamepad.
* Fixes bug in Driver Station where on the Driver Hub, if Advanced Gamepad Features was disabled and
  an officially supported gamepad was connected, then opening the Advanced Gamepad Features or
  Gamepad Type Overrides screens would cause the gamepad to be rebound by the custom USB driver even
  though advanced gamepad features was disabled.
* Protects against (unlikely) null pointer exception in Vuforia Localizer.
* Harden OnBotJava and Blocks saves to protect against save issues when disconnecting from Program and Manage
* Fixes issue where the RC app would hang if a REV Hub I2C write failed because the previous I2C
  operation was still in progress. This hang most commonly occurred during REV 2M Distance Sensor initialization
* Removes ConceptWebcam.java sample program.  This sample is not compatible with OnBotJava.
* Fixes bug where using html tags in an @ExportToBlocks comment field prevented the blocks editor from loading.
* Fixes blocks editor so it doesn't ask you to save when you haven't modified anything.
* Fixes uploading a very large blocks project to offline blocks editor.
* Fixes bug that caused blocks for DcMotorEx to be omitted from the blocks editor toolbox.
* Fixes [Blocks Programs Stripped of Blocks (due to using TensorFlow Label block)](https://ftcforum.firstinspires.org/forum/ftc-technology/blocks-programming/87035-blocks-programs-stripped-of-blocks)

## Version 7.1 (20211223-120805)

* Fixes crash when calling `isPwmEnabled()` ([issue #223](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/233)).
* Fixes lint error ([issue #4](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/4)).
* Fixes Driver Station crash when attempting to use DualShock4 v1 gamepad with Advanced Gamepad Features enabled ([issue #173](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/173)).
* Fixes possible (but unlikely) Driver Station crash when connecting gamepads of any type.
* Fixes bug where Driver Station would use generic 20% deadzone for Xbox360 and Logitech F310 gamepads when Advanced Gamepad Features was disabled.
* Added SimpleOmniDrive sample OpMode.
* Adds UVC white balance control API.
* Fixes [issue #259](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/259) Most blocks samples for TensorFlow can't be used for a different model.
    * The blocks previously labeled TensorFlowObjectDetectionFreightFrenzy (from the subcategory named "Optimized for Freight Frenzy") and TensorFlowObjectDetectionCustomModel (from the subcategory named "Custom Model") have been replaced with blocks labeled TensorFlowObjectDetection. Blocks in existing opmodes will be automatically updated to the new blocks when opened in the blocks editor.
* Fixes [issue #260](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/260) Blocks can't call java method that has a VuforiaLocalizer parameter.
    * Blocks now has a block labeled VuforiaFreightFrenzy.getVuforiaLocalizer for this.
* Added a page to manage the TensorFlow Lite models in /sdcard/FIRST/tflitemodels. To get to the TFLite Models page:
    * You can click on the link at the bottom of the the Manage page.
    * You can click on the link at the upper-right the Blocks project page.
* Fixes logspam when `isBusy()` is called on a motor not in RTP mode.
* Hides the "RC Password" item on the inspection screen for phone-based Robot Controllers. (It is only applicable for Control Hubs).
* Adds channel 165 to Wi-Fi Direct channel selection menu in the settings screen. (165 was previously available through the web UI, but not locally in the app).

## Version 7.0 (20210915-141025)

### Enhancements and New Features
* Adds support for external libraries to OnBotJava and Blocks.
    * Upload .jar and .aar files in OnBotJava.
      * Known limitation - RobotController device must be running Android 7.0 or greater.
      * Known limitation - .aar files with assets are not supported.
    * External libraries can provide support for hardware devices by using the annotation in the
      com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.configuration.annotations package.
    * External libraries can include .so files for native code.
    * External libraries can be used from OnBotJava op modes.
    * External libraries that use the following annotations can be used from Blocks op modes.
      * org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.ExportClassToBlocks
      * org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.ExportToBlocks
    * External libraries that use the following annotations can add new hardware devices:
      * com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.configuration.annotations.AnalogSensorType
      * com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.configuration.annotations.DeviceProperties
      * com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.configuration.annotations.DigitalIoDeviceType
      * com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.configuration.annotations.I2cDeviceType
      * com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.configuration.annotations.MotorType
      * com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.configuration.annotations.ServoType

    * Allows gamepads to work on devices without native Linux kernel support (e.g. some Romanian Motorola devices).
    * Allows the DS to read the unique serial number of each gamepad, enabling auto-recovery of dropped gamepads even if two gamepads of the same model drop. *(NOTE: unfortunately this does not apply to Etpark gamepads, because they do not have a unique serial)*.
    * Reading the unique serial number also provides the ability to configure the DS to assign gamepads to a certain position by default (so no need to do start+a/b at all).
    * The LED ring on the Xbox360 gamepad and the RGB LED bar on the PS4 gamepad is used to indicate the driver position the gamepad is bound to.
    * The rumble motors on the Xbox360, PS4, and Etpark gamepads can be controlled from OpModes.
    * The 2-point touchpad on the PS4 gamepad can be read from OpModes.
    * The "back" and "guide" buttons on the gamepad can now be safely bound to robot controls (Previously, on many devices, Android would intercept these buttons as home button presses and close the app).
    * Advanced Gamepad features are enabled by default, but may be disabled through the settings menu in order to revert to gamepad support provided natively by Android.
* Improves accuracy of ping measurement.
    * Fixes issue where the ping time showed as being higher than reality when initially connecting to or restarting the robot.
    * To see the full improvement, you must update both the Robot Controller and Driver Station apps.
* Updates samples located at [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples](FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples).
    * Added ConceptGamepadRumble and ConceptGamepadTouchpad samples to illustrate the use of these new gampad capabilities.
    * Condensed existing Vuforia samples into just 2 samples (ConceptVuforiaFieldNavigation & ConceptVuforiaFieldNavigationWebcam) showing how to determine the robot's location on the field using Vuforia. These both use the current season's Target images.
    * Added ConceptVuforiaDriveToTargetWebcam to illustrate an easy way to drive directly to any visible Vuforia target.
* Makes many improvements to the warning system and individual warnings.
    * Warnings are now much more spaced out, so that they are easier to read.
    * New warnings were added for conditions that should be resolved before competing.
    * The mismatched apps warning now uses the major and minor app versions, not the version code.
    * The warnings are automatically re-enabled when a Robot Controller app from a new FTC season is installed.
* Adds support for I2C transactions on the Expansion Hub / Control Hub without specifying a register address.
    * See section 3 of the [TI I2C spec](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva704/slva704.pdf).
    * Calling these new methods when using Modern Robotics hardware will result in an UnsupportedOperationException.
* Changes VuforiaLocalizer `close()` method to be public.
* Adds support for TensorFlow v2 object detection models.
* Reduces ambiguity of the Self Inspect language and graphics.
* OnBotJava now warns about potentially unintended file overwrites.
* Improves behavior of the Wi-Fi band and channel selector on the Manage webpage.

### Bug fixes
 * Fixes Robot Controller app crash on Android 9+ when a Driver Station connects.
 * Fixes issue where an Op Mode was responsible for calling shutdown on the
   TensorFlow TFObjectDetector. Now this is done automatically.
 * Fixes Vuforia initialization blocks to allow user to chose AxesOrder. Updated
   relevant blocks sample opmodes.
 * Fixes [FtcRobotController issue #114](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/114)
   LED blocks and Java class do not work.
 * Fixes match logging for Op Modes that contain special characters in their names.
 * Fixes Driver Station OpMode controls becoming unresponsive if the Driver Station was set to the landscape layout and an OnBotJava build was triggered while an OpMode was running.
 * Fixes the Driver Station app closing itself when it is switched away from, or the screen is turned off.
 * Fixes "black swirl of doom" (Infinite "configuring Wi-Fi Direct" message) on older devices.
 * Updates the wiki comment on the OnBotJava intro page.

## Version 6.2 (20210218-074821)

### Enhancements
* Attempts to automatically fix the condition where a Control Hub's internal Expansion Hub is not
  working by re-flashing its firmware
* Makes various improvements to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing screen, especially in landscape mode
* Makes the Robot Controller service no longer be categorically restarted when the main activity is brought to foreground
    * (e.g. the service is no longer restarted simply by viewing the Self Inspect screen and pressing the back button)
    * It is still restarted if the Settings menu or Configure Robot menu is opened


### Bug fixes
* Fixes [FtcRobotController issue #71](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/71)
  Cannot open OpModes in v6.1 Blocks offline editor
* Fixes [FtcRobotController issue #79](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/issues/79)
  6.1 causes a soft reboot on the Motorola E5 Play

  the Control Hub was not able to communicate with its internal Expansion Hub
* Fixes certain I2C devices not showing up in the appropriate `HardwareMap` fields (such as `hardwareMap.colorSensor`) 
* Fixes issue where performing a Wi-Fi factory reset on the Control Hub would not set the Wi-Fi band to 2.4 GHz
* Fixes issue where OnBotJava might fail to create a new file if the option to "Setup Code for Configured Hardware" was selected
* Fixes issue where performing certain operations after an Op Mode crashes would temporarily break Control/Expansion Hub communication
* Fixes issue where a Control Hub with a configured USB-connected Expansion Hub would not work if the Expansion Hub was missing at startup
* Fixes potential issues caused by having mismatched Control/Expansion Hub firmware versions 
* Fixes [ftc_app issue 673](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/673) Latest matchlog is being deleted instead of old ones by RobotLog
* Fixes ConceptVuforiaUltimateGoalNavigationWebcam sample opmode by correctly orienting camera on robot.
* Fixes issue where logcat would be spammed with InterruptedExceptions when stop is requested from the Driver Station (this behavior was accidentally introduced in v5.3). This change has no impact on functionality.

* Fixes issue in UVC driver where some cameras (e.g. certain MS Lifecams) which reported frame intervals as rounded rather than truncated values (e.g. `666667*100ns` instead of `666666*100ns` for 15FPS) would fail to start streaming.
* Adds support in UVC driver for virtual PTZ control
* Adds support in UVC driver for gain (ISO) control
* Adds support in UVC driver for enabling/disable AE priority. This setting provides a means to tell the camera firmware either
    * A) It can undershoot the requested frame rate in order to provide a theoretically better image (i.e. with a longer exposure than the inter-frame period of the selected frame rate allows)
    * B) It *must* meet the inter-frame deadline for the selected frame rate, even if the image may be underexposed as a result
* Adds support for the Control Hub OS 1.1.2 Robot Controller watchdog
    * The Robot Controller app will be restarted if it stops responding for more than 10 seconds
* Adds support for using the Driver Station app on Android 10+

    * For details and usage guide, please see [this wiki entry](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Automatically-Loading-a-Driver-Controlled-Op-Mode)
* Shows icon next to OpMode name in the OpMode list dropdown on the Driver Station to indicate the source of the OpMode (i.e. the programming tool used to create it)
* Fixes issue where the Driver Station app would exit after displaying the Configuring Wi-Fi Direct screen
* Fixes Blocks and OnBotJava prompts when accessed via the REV Hardware Client

## Version 6.0 (20200921-085816)

### Important Notes
* Version 6.0 is the version for the Ultimate Goal season.
* Requires Android Studio 4.0.
* Android Studio users need to be connected to the Internet the first time they build the app (in order to download needed packages for the build).
* Version 5.5 was a moderately large off-season, August 2020, drop.  It's worth reviewing those release notes below also.
* Version 5.5 and greater will not work on older Android 4.x and 5.x phones.  Users must upgrade to an approved Android 6.x device or newer.
* The default PIDF values for REV motors have been reverted to the default PID values that were used in the 2018-2019 season
    * This change was made because the 2018-2019 values turned out to work better for many mechanisms
    * This brings the behavior of the REV motors in line with the behavior of all other motors
    * If you prefer the 2019-2020 season's behavior for REV motors, here are the PIDF values that were in place, so that you can manually set them in your OpModes:
      <br>
      **HD Hex motors (all gearboxes):**
      Velocity PIDF values: `P = 1.17`, `I = 0.117`, `F = 11.7`
      Position PIDF values: `P = 5.0`
      **Core Hex motor:**
      Velocity PIDF values: `P = 4.96`, `I = 0.496`, `F = 49.6`
      Position PIDF values: `P = 5.0`

### New features
* Includes TensorFlow inference model and sample op modes to detect Ultimate Goal Starter Stacks (four rings vs single ring stack).
* Includes Vuforia Ultimate Goal vision targets and sample op modes.
* Introduces a digital zoom feature for TensorFlow object detection (to detect objects more accurately at greater distances).
* Adds configuration entry for the REV UltraPlanetary HD Hex motor

### Enhancements
* Adds setGain() and getGain() methods to the NormalizedColorSensor interface
    * By setting the gain of a color sensor, you can adjust for different lighting conditions.
      For example, if you detect lower color values than expected, you can increase the gain.
    * The gain value is only applied to the argb() and getNormalizedColors() methods, not to the raw color methods.
      The getNormalizedColors() method is recommended for ease-of-use and clarity, since argb() has to be converted.
    * Updates SensorColor Java sample to demonstrate gain usage
* Merges SensorREVColorDistance Java sample into SensorColor Java sample, which showcases best practices for all color sensors
* Improves retrieving values from the REV Color Sensor V3
    * Updates the normalization calculation of the RGB channels
    * Improves the calculation of the alpha channel (can be used as an overall brightness indicator)
    * Fixes the default sensor resolution, which caused issues with bright environments
    * Adds support for changing the resolution and measuring rate of the Broadcom sensor chip
    * Removes IR readings and calculations not meant for the Broadcom sensor chip

### Bug fixes
* Improves reliability of BNO055IMU IMU initialization to prevent random initialization failures (which manifested as `Problem with 'imu'`).

## Version 5.5 (20200824-090813)

Version 5.5 requires Android Studio 4.0 or later.

### New features
* Adds support for calling custom Java classes from Blocks OpModes (fixes [SkyStone issue #161](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/161)).
    * Classes must be in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package.
    * To have easy access to the opMode, hardwareMap, telemetry, gamepad1, and gamepad2, classes can
      extends org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.BlocksOpModeCompanion.
    * Methods must be public static and have no more than 21 parameters.
    * Methods must be annotated with org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.ExportToBlocks.
    * Parameters declared as OpMode, LinearOpMode, Telemetry, and HardwareMap are supported and the
      argument is provided automatically, regardless of the order of the parameters. On the block,
      the sockets for those parameters are automatically filled in.
    * Parameters declared as char or java.lang.Character will accept any block that returns text
      and will only use the first character in the text.
    * Parameters declared as boolean or java.lang.Boolean will accept any block that returns boolean.
    * Parameters declared as byte, java.lang.Byte, short, java.lang.Short, int, java.lang.Integer,
      long, or java.lang.Long,  will accept any block that returns a number and will round that
      value to the nearest whole number.
    * Parameters declared as float, java.lang.Float, double, java.lang.Double will accept any
      block that returns a number.
* Adds telemetry API method for setting display format
    * Classic
    * Monospace
    * HTML (certain tags only)
* Adds blocks support for switching cameras.
* Adds Blocks support for TensorFlow Object Detection with a custom model.
* Adds support for uploading a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model in the Manage page, which
  is especially useful for Blocks and OnBotJava users.
* Shows new Control Hub blink codes when the Wi-Fi band is switched using the Control Hub's button (only possible on Control Hub OS 1.1.2)
* Adds new warnings which can be disabled in the Advanced RC Settings
    * Mismatched app versions warning
    * Unnecessary 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi usage warning
    * REV Hub is running outdated firmware (older than version 1.8.2)
* Adds support for Sony PS4 gamepad, and reworks how gamepads work on the Driver Station
    * Removes preference which sets gamepad type based on driver position. Replaced with menu which allows specifying type for gamepads with unknown VID and PID
	* Attempts to auto-detect gamepad type based on USB VID and PID
	* If gamepad VID and PID is not known, use type specified by user for that VID and PID
	* If gamepad VID and PID is not known AND the user has not specified a type for that VID and PID, an educated guess is made about how to map the gamepad
* Driver Station will now attempt to automatically recover from a gamepad disconnecting, and re-assign it to the position it was assigned to when it dropped
    * If only one gamepad is assigned and it drops: it can be recovered
    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **different** VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered
    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **different** VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: both will be recovered
    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **the same** VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered
    * If two gamepads are assigned, and have **the same** VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: **neither** will be recovered, because of the ambiguity of the gamepads when they re-appear on the USB bus.
    * There is currently one known edge case: if there are **two** gamepads with **the same** VID/PID signature plugged in, **but only one is assigned**, and they BOTH drop, it's a 50-50 chance of which one will be chosen for automatic recovery to the assigned position: it is determined by whichever one is re-enumerated first by the USB bus controller.
* Adds landscape user interface to Driver Station
    * New feature: practice timer with audio cues
    * New feature (Control Hub only): wireless network connection strength indicator (0-5 bars)
    * New feature (Control Hub only): tapping on the ping/channel display will switch to an alternate display showing radio RX dBm and link speed (tap again to switch back)
    * The layout will NOT autorotate. You can switch the layout from the Driver Station's settings menu.

## Version 5.4 (20200108-101156)
* Fixes [SkyStone issue #88](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/88)
* Adds an inspection item that notes when a robot controller (Control Hub) is using the factory default password.
* Fixes [SkyStone issue #61](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/61)

* Fixes system responsiveness issue when an Expansion Hub is disconnected
* Fixes issue where IMU initialization could prevent Op Modes from stopping
* Fixes issue where AndroidTextToSpeech.speak() would fail if it was called too early
* Adds telemetry.speak() methods and blocks, which cause the Driver Station (if also updated) to speak text
* Adds and improves Expansion Hub-related warnings
    * Improves Expansion Hub low battery warning
        * Displays the warning immediately after the hub reports it
        * Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run
        * Displays which hubs reported low battery
    * Displays warning when hub loses and regains power during an OpMode run
        * Fixes the hub's LED pattern after this condition
    * Displays warning when Expansion Hub is not responding to commands
        * Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run
    * Clarifies warning when Expansion Hub is not present at startup
        * Specifies that this condition requires a Robot Restart before the hub can be used.
        * The hub light will now accurately reflect this state
    * Improves logging and reduces log spam during these conditions
* Syncs the Control Hub time and timezone to a connected web browser programming the robot, if a Driver Station is not available.
* Adds bulk read functionality for REV Hubs
  * A bulk caching mode must be set at the Hub level with `LynxModule#setBulkCachingMode()`. This applies to all relevant SDK hardware classes that reference that Hub.
  * The following following Hub bulk caching modes are available:
    * `BulkCachingMode.OFF` (default): All hardware calls operate as usual. Bulk data can read through `LynxModule#getBulkData()` and processed manually.
    * `BulkCachingMode.AUTO`: Applicable hardware calls are served from a bulk read cache that is cleared/refreshed automatically to ensure identical commands don't hit the same cache. The cache can also be cleared manually with `LynxModule#clearBulkCache()`, although this is not recommended.
    * (advanced users) `BulkCachingMode.MANUAL`: Same as `BulkCachingMode.AUTO` except the cache is never cleared automatically. To avoid getting stale data, the cache must be manually cleared at the beginning of each loop body or as the user deems appropriate.
* Removes PIDF Annotation values added in Rev 5.3 (to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations).
  * The new motor types will still be available but their Default control behavior will revert back to Rev 5.2
* Adds new `ConceptMotorBulkRead` sample Opmode to demonstrate and compare Motor Bulk-Read modes for reducing I/O latencies.

## Version 5.3 (20191004-112306)
* Fixes external USB/UVC webcam support
* Makes various bugfixes and improvements to Blocks page, including but not limited to:
    * Many visual tweaks
    * Browser zoom and window resize behave better
    * Resizing the Java preview pane works better and more consistently across browsers
    * The Java preview pane consistently gets scrollbars when needed
    * The Java preview pane is hidden by default on phones
    * Internet Explorer 11 should work
    * Large dropdown lists display properly on lower res screens
    * Disabled buttons are now visually identifiable as disabled
    * A warning is shown if a user selects a TFOD sample, but their device is not compatible
    * Warning messages in a Blocks op mode are now visible by default.
* Adds goBILDA 5201 and 5202 motors to Robot Configurator
* Adds PIDF Annotation values to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations.
    This has the effect of causing the RUN_USING_ENCODERS and RUN_TO_POSITION modes to use
    PIDF vs PID closed loop control on these motors.  This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control.
    PIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop.
    Feedforward is useful when controlling a motor's speed because it "anticipates" how much the control voltage
    must change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently.
    The PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor.
    The more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be.
* Fixes startup crash on Android 10
* Fixes [ftc_app issue #712](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/712) (thanks to FROGbots-4634)
* Fixes [ftc_app issue #542](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/542)

* Removes older (season-specific) sample op modes.
* Includes 64-bit support (to comply with [Google Play requirements](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html)).
* Protects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) ([ftc_app issue #709](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/709))
* Blocks related changes:
   * Fixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word.
   * Shows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration.
   * Displays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used ([SkyStone issue #27](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone/issues/27))

## Version 5.1 (20190820-222104)
* Defines default PIDF parameters for the following motors:
    * REV Core Hex Motor

* Fixes [ftc_app issue #715](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/715)
* Prevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state.
* Prevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC
* Adds support for REV Color Sensor V3
* Adds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames.
    * To show the stream on the DS, initialize **but do not run** a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD—no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again.
    * Note that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution.
    * To use custom streams, consult the API docs for `CameraStreamServer#setSource` and `CameraStreamSource`.
* Adds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources.
* Added Skystone Sounds Chooser Sample Program.
* Switches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds
* Updates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot
    * The OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another

Known issues:
* Camera Stream
    * The Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely [ftc_app issue #574](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/574)). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia.
    * The orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom `CameraStreamSource` if desired.
* OnBotJava
    * Browser back button may not always work correctly
    * It's possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs.
    * A user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab.

## Version 5.0 (built on 19.06.14)
 * Support for the REV Robotics Control Hub.
 * Adds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor.
 * Adds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor.

 * Keep Alives to mitigate the Motorola Wi-Fi scanning problem.  Telemetry substitute no longer necessary.
 * Improves Vuforia error reporting.
 * Fixes ftctechnh/ftc_app issues 621, 713.
 * Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.

## Version 4.3 (built on 18.10.31)
 * Includes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files.

## Version 4.2 (built on 18.10.30)
 * Includes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors.
     - Comm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover.
     - robotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words "E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:"
 * Includes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file.
     - Bug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as "1".
     - If the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub.
 * Added requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices.
 * Added google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin.
     - Important Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project.
     - Internet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository.
     - Users should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds.
     - This should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it "Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4" (or similar).
 * Added support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub.
 * Provide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode.
 * Block Development Tool Changes
     - Includes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum).
     - Change the "Save completed successfully." message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background.
     - Fixed the "Download image" feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode.
 * Introduce support for Google's TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game.
     - TensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game.
     - Example Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right).

 * Updated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example.
 * Update SDK library version number.

## Version 4.0 (released on 18.09.12)

Changes include:
 * Initial support for UVC compatible cameras
    - If UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.
    - If UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.
    - Calibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details).
    - User can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface.
    - UVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus.
         + This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.
	 + This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.
	 + FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.
    - Updated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.

 * Support for improved motor control.
    - REV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.
    - FTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward).
    - FTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks.
    - Deprecated older PID-related methods and variables.
    - REV's 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor.

 * Wireless
    - Added 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it.
        + Tested with Moto G5 and E4 phones.
	+ Also tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8.

* Improved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app
    - Changes to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).
    - User no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub's firmware.
        + If user is updating an Expansion Hub's firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.
	+ The user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub's firmware.
	+ The user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.
    - If an Expansion Hub accidentally gets "bricked" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.
        + Robot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.
	+ Robot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.

 * Resiliency
    - FTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.
        + When enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn't communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.
	+ If the Hub hasn't heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.
	+ This action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.
    - Various fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.

 * Blocks
    - Fixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.
    - Support for USB connected UVC webcams.
    - Refactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.
    - Added programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control.
    - Added formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value.
    - Support to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller.
    - Fixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature.
    - Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.
    - Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.
    - Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).
    - Added blocks for DcMotorEx methods.
        + These are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware.
	+ The REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods.
	+ Enhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc..

 * Modest Improvements in Logging
    - Decrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements.
    - Removed non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible).
    - Introduced a "Match Logging" feature.
        + Under "Settings" a user can enable/disable this feature (it's disabled by default).
	+ If enabled, user provides a "Match Number" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen).
	    * The Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run.
	    * Match log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller.
	    * Once an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared.
	    * This is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run.

 * New Devices
    - Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.
    - Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.
    - Added configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor.
    - Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).

 * Miscellaneous
    - Fixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation.
    - Added ability to play audio files on Driver Station
    - When user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan)  to indicate which Hub is currently being configured.
    - Renamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType.
    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets.
    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor.
    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.
    - Re-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to "TeleOp" instead of "Autonomous".

Known issues:
 * Initial support for UVC compatible cameras
    - UVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus.
        + This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.
	+ This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.
	+ FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.
    - There might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.

 * Wireless
    - When user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.
        + Tech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.
	+ Issue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).
    - Wireless channel is not currently displayed for Wi-Fi Direct connections.
